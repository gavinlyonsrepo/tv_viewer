Log file
----------------------------

Exceptions are generated by software as a result of missing and incomplete 
API data by TV maze for some shows. These are caught and outputted 
to log file and won't interfere with running of program. 
The software should catch most issues 
and output them there. Also displayed here are various other debug information.
Logging can be switched on and off in and the output path  can be changed.
